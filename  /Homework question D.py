### Part D: What will be the output?

#Let's analyze the provided code snippet:


x = 5
y = 2.396
print("The answer is the following:")
print(x + int(y))


### Explanation:

#1. **Variable Initialization:**
# - `x` is assigned the value `5` (an integer).
#- `y` is assigned the value `2.36` (a floating-point number).

#2. **Type Conversion and Addition:**
 #  - The `int()` function is used to convert `y` from a floating-point number to an integer. This conversion will truncate the decimal part, resulting in `2`.
 #  - The addition operation `x + int(y)` will therefore be `5 + 2`.

#3. **Print Statement:**
  # - The `print` function will output the result of the addition.

### Expected Output:

#7


#So, when you run this code, it will print `7` to the console.
