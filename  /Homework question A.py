# Part A
# 1. Create a variable named 'first' with the value 7
first = 7

# 2. Create a variable named 'second' with the value 44.3
second = 44.3

# 3. Print the result of adding 'first' to 'second'
addition_result = first + second
print("The result of adding first to second is:", addition_result)

# 4. Print the result of multiplying 'first' by 'second'
multiplication_result = first * second
print("The result of multiplying first by second is:", multiplication_result)

# 5. Print the result of dividing 'second' by 'first'
division_result = second / first
print("The result of dividing second by first is:", division_result)

#Explanation:

	#1.	Variable Initialization:
	#•	first is assigned the value 7.
	#•	second is assigned the value 44.3.
	#2.	Addition:
	#•	The addition result of first and second is calculated and stored in addition_result.
	#•	This result is then printed.
	#3.	Multiplication:
	#•	The multiplication result of first and second is calculated and stored in multiplication_result.
	#•	This result is then printed.
	#4.	Division:
	#•	The division result of second by first is calculated and stored in division_result.
	#•	This result is then printed.

#By running this program, you will see the results of these arithmetic operations printed on the console.
