### Part C: Issue with the Code

#**What is the issue with the code below?**


#my_number = 5 + 5
#print("result is: " + my_number)


#**Issue:**

#The issue with this code is that it tries to concatenate a string (`"result is: "`) with an integer (`my_number`). In Python, you cannot directly concatenate a string with an integer. You need to convert the integer to a string before concatenation.

#**Suggested Edit:**

#You can fix this issue by converting `my_number` to a string using the `str()` function. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:


my_number = 5 + 5
print("result option a is: " + str(my_number))  # Convert my_number to a string before concatenating


#Alternatively, you can use formatted strings (also known as f-strings) in Python for a more elegant solution:


my_number = 5 + 5
print(f"result option b is: {my_number}")  # Use f-string for formatting


#Both of these solutions will correctly print the result.
