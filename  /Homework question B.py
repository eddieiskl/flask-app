#To improve the readability and visual understandability of the code, I'll add print statements that show the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` at each step, along with explanations for each operation.


# Initial values
a = 8
b = 6

# Print initial values
print("Initial values:")
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print()

# Step 1: Calculate c as the sum of a and b
c = a + b
print("After calculating c = a + b:")
print("c =", c)
print()

# Step 2: Update b as c - a
b = c - a
print("After updating b = c - a:")
print("b =", b)
print()

# Step 3: Update a as c - b
a = c - b
print("After updating a = c - b:")
print("a =", a)
print()

# Final values
print("Final values:")
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("c =", c)


### Explanation:

#1. **Initial Values:**
#  - The initial values of `a` and `b` are printed.

#2. **Step-by-Step Calculations:**
#   - **Step 1:** `c` is calculated as the sum of `a` and `b`, and the new value of `c` is printed.
#   - **Step 2:** `b` is updated to `c - a`, and the new value of `b` is printed.
#   - **Step 3:** `a` is updated to `c - b`, and the new value of `a` is printed.

#3. **Final Values:**
#   - The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are printed to show the results of the operations.

### Expected Output:


#Initial values:
a = 8
b = 6

#After calculating c = a + b:
c = 14

#After updating b = c - a:
b = 6

#After updating a = c - b:
a = 8

#Final values:
a = 8
b = 6
c = 14


#This enhanced code provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of what is happening at each stage of the computation, making it visually understandable while running.

#You can copy this code into a Python interpreter or a script file and run it to see the results. The comments in the code should help you understand what each part of the code is doing.
