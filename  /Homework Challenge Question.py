### Challenge: Fix the following code without changing `a` or `b`

#The provided code snippet is:

#a = 8
#b = "123"
#print(a + b)


#**Issue:**

#The issue with this code is that it tries to add an integer (`a`) to a string (`b`), which is not allowed in Python. To fix this without changing `a` or `b`, we need to perform a type conversion.

#**Solution:**

#We should convert the string `b` to an integer before performing the addition. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

a = 8
b = "123"
print(a + int(b))  # Convert b to an integer before adding

### Explanation:

#1. **Variable Initialization:**
#  - `a` is assigned the value `8` (an integer).
# - `b` is assigned the value `"123"` (a string).

#2. **Type Conversion:**
#   - The `int()` function is used to convert `b` from a string to an integer. This conversion changes `"123"` to `123`.

#3. **Addition:**
 #  - The addition operation `a + int(b)` will be `8 + 123`.

#4. **Print Statement:**
#   - The `print` function will output the result of the addition.

### Expected Output:

#131

#This will print `131` to the console.
